# 🧭 Pathfinding Visualizer

An interactive, grid-based simulation tool for visualizing classical search algorithms in real-time using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. It supports animated execution of BFS, DFS, Dijkstra’s, A*, and Greedy Best-First Search, along with procedural maze generation.

## 🚀 Features

- Dynamic, resolution-independent grid layout
- Algorithms: BFS, DFS, Dijkstra’s, A*, Greedy Best-First Search
- Manhattan Distance heuristic integration
- Recursive Division Maze Generation
- Adjustable animation speed (Slow, Normal, Fast)
- Pause, Resume, and Reset controls
- Drag-and-drop source and target nodes
- Real-time wall creation via pointer events
- Responsive design with smooth CSS transitions

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- HTML, CSS (Keyframe Animations)
- JavaScript (DOM manipulation, pointer events)

## 🧠 Algorithms

- Breadth-First Search (BFS)
- Depth-First Search (DFS)
- Dijkstra’s Algorithm (with min-heap)
- A* Search (Manhattan Distance Heuristic)
- Greedy Best-First Search

## 🧩 Maze Generation

- Recursive Division with vertical/horizontal wall toggling
- Instant or animated build modes

## 📝 Usage

- Left click and drag to create walls  
- Drag start/end nodes to reposition  
- Select algorithm, speed, and cell size from the dropdowns  
- Click “Start” to begin visualization
